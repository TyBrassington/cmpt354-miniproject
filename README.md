# Library Database Application

This is a full-stack web application designed for managing a library database for the CMPT354 Database Systems I mini-project. The application allows library users to:

- **Find an item in the library**
- **Borrow an item from the library**
- **Return a borrowed item**
- **Donate an item to the library**
- **Find an event in the library**
- **Register for an event**
- **Volunteer for the library**
- **Ask for help from a librarian**

> **Note:** You will be required to create an account in order to use most functions in the application.

The backend is built using Python with SQLite and Flask, while the frontend is developed using React and Vite.

> **Note:** For detailed installation and setup instructions, please refer to the included [INSTRUCTIONS.md](./INSTRUCTIONS.md) file.
